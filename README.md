## INTRODUCTION / INSTRUCTION


Classification system for the knavehaven archive. Schema for the purpose or sorting reference materials from online ventures of patrons of knaveHaven, as well as documentation of workspaces, projects, and other assets.

This is an informal classification system used for the organization of personal
information retrieval ventures by the patrons of knaveHaven[1], knaveHaven.net, etc.

The "Universe of Knowledge" encompasses the body of links internet artifacts, short form
blurbs, essays, notes of knaveHaven.

It was a means of organizing bookmarks and internet ephemera for the sake of retrieval
and navigation for the sake of think pieces to be produced.

### Type of Classification

knaveHaven classification or (kHC) is a hybrid specialized-general classification system.

knaveHaven can be considered specialized, under that it is oriented towards the documentation of knaveHaven experiencing the internet, via the cataloguing and organization of net artifacts as well as the creation of others under this haven.
ALSO DUE TO ARBITRARY NATURE (it is restricted to knaveHaven's worldview)

kHC also uses a generalized ethos due to the potential of online engagements falling under a universe of knowledge despite knaveHaven having specialized interests[2].

### Enumerative || Faceted

From 09.2019 - 03.2020 It  aimed to be an enumerative scheme with prebuilt class numbers while also using a scheme to build such class numbers.

It has number 0-9 representing the nature of knowledge (0 being information itself, 5 concerning people, 9 being ethnographic, etc.) Where every class composed of that number would be a slicing or subdivision of said body's nature. (i.e. 090 would be the body of knowledge that deals with information, with 9 having an ethnographic approach, making 090 - "Journaling, Self-Documentation";
INSERT ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE)


04.2020 - onwards knaveHaven has come to terms that it is indeed a faceted scheme due to the rules relying on prebuilt contructs as well as the ethos of "ever-evolving" shifting, generating class numbers.


## HISTORY / DEV TIMELINE

### 20.03.20

added folders to drive
the classification system has taken on the form of a folder filesystem on the tentaviely named
001_knavehaven_classification directory on the knaveHaven github.


### 19 - 20.04.20

more documentaion through markdown file in atom rather than scattered through various channels in are.na .

problems with hiearchy and file structure, the system shall now be oriented towards keywords rather than attempting to establish subdivisions/sors of subjects, as well as hiearchial relations to them.

inspiration came from backspacing the colored two people holding hands emoji in markdown


### 21.04.20

started swapping the 100s schedule around, to fit with a natural progression of subjects, by the same scheme of the main schedules. (i.e, INFRASTRUCTURE moved from 020 to 050 due to [5] being associated with [5]00 - SOCIETY, so [0]__ INFO concerning an aspect of [5] society or people interacting as a whole would make 050 - INFRASTRUCTURE )

### 22.04.20

Worked on A00, D00, and C00 schedules, referenced documents in different machines and locations; consolidated the train of thought from each.

"RELIGION" was moved out of METAPHYSICAL into HEAVEN & EARTH. The reasoning was to not only make room for SIGNS-ICONS-ETC but also because religion covers the institutions, created by man rather than ephemera and documents having surrounding  properties of solely transcending matter and natural law.

### 23.04.20

TODO: look at that email with the classification system stuff

also work on creating universal system design template

### 29.04.20

Our current direction with kHC is to be more simplified regarding the creation of sub-schedules.
This is due to our stagnation in feeling the need to articulate said sub schedule into 3 layers of specificity, while also maintaining the presence of an article in another channel/ schedule.

As much as possible we will try to restrain it to keywords ONLY, this way we don't run into
the conundrum of putting a javascript tutorial in 043 WEB, and 880 PROGRAMMING

As a result, we changed 880 PROGRAMMING to 880 - MECHANISMS since programming is not needed
if 040 COMPUTER SCIENCE encompasses implementations of technology AND conceptual frameworks.


### 30.04.20

D58 COMPUTING was added to solve the problem of computers belonging in 040 Computer Science, and 080 Information technology.

040 and 080 are strictly conceptual areas and implementations of technology, whereas
D58 refers to set ups and configurations. This is important because the Computing being in the D00 schedule implies that the user is an agent in this subject.

### 13.05.20  

Realized that it is unfair to exclude work (creations of knaveHaven) from knowledge repository through making the C and D alphanumericals
exclusively for original content and notes. The purpose of are.na is to transform digital ephemera and the act of bookmarking into something  
pro-active, so each channel shall act as intended by are.na's design: one part repository and one part workspace.  

For easy access of original content, it shall be compiled within the 900s schedule via the connect feature in are.na, since it
is RECORDing knaveHaven's activity.

## TABLES

## SEQUENCING

A feature of kHC is a very earnest attempt to have a gradual progression of area of knowledge flowing into another. This is in part of being inspired by Zin's pillars of knowledge as well as the principle of helpful sequence present in many classification systems. [^3]

## MAIN CLASSES


Main Classes of kHC was originally inspired by Chaim Zin's 10 pillars of knowledge.

Somewhere in 11.2019 - 12.2019 knaveHaven came to the realization that they were not interested so heavily in things such as "Pillar 3: Matter and Energy" or "Pillar 4: Space and Earth" so heavily to a point where investing resources into mapping the nuance of these subjects was not worth it. Also, Pillar 8: "Thought and Art" created a huge dissonance in how we perceived knowledge due to thought being a separate category to perceiving knowledge rather than a somatic mean of experiencing art like in Zin's framework. This is an instance of us realizing kHC was less of a general system and more of a specialized one.  

Because of this, we chopped and mixed the pillars of knowledge and renamed them to the following:

The lens of experiencing knowledge is through a strictly hermeunetic and epistemelogical approach, as things such as fundamental forces belong in METAPHYSICAL rather than TECH.

## FOOTNOTES

[1] knaveHaven is a multimedia production group that aims to motivate the independence, freeware, lo-fidelity, decentralized use information technology and information systems through design of technologies that share such ethos

[2] Usually concerning human computer interaction, information systems, the intersection if IT and arts, game design as a framework for critical thought, pop media analyzation

[3] : Inspired by this excerpt on the Bliss bibliographic classification system wikipedia page accessed 30.04.20

"The four broad underlying policies of the BC system are:[4]

alternative location
brief, concise notation
organizing knowledge according to academic expertise
subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.
Bliss deliberately avoided the use of the decimal point because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric typewriter.

Single letter codes refer to broad subject areas and further letters are added to refer to increasingly specific subdisciplines. For example, at Lancaster University[6]:

T Economics
TD Business Economics
TDG Management of Industry"
