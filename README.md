## INTRODUCTION / INSTRUCTION




Classification system for the knavehaven archive. Schema for the purpose or sorting reference materials from online ventures of patrons of knaveHaven, as well as documentation of workspaces, projects, and other assets.

This is an informal classification system used for the organization of personal
information retrieval ventures by the patrons of knaveHaven[1], knaveHaven.net, etc.

The "Universe of Knowledge" encompasses the body of links internet artifacts, short form
blurbs, essays, notes of knaveHaven.

It was a means of organizing bookmarks and internet ephemera for the sake of retrieval
and navigation for the sake of think pieces to be produced.

### Type of Classification

knaveHaven classification or (kHC) is a hybrid specialized-general classification system.

knaveHaven can be considered specialized, under that it is oriented towards the documentation of knaveHaven experiencing the internet, via the cataloguing and organization of net artifacts as well as the creation of others under this haven.

kHC also uses a generalized ethos due to the potential of online engagements falling under a universe of knowledge despite knaveHaven having specialized interests[2].

### Enumerative || Faceted

From 09.2019 - 03.2020 It  aimed to be an enumerative scheme with prebuilt class numbers while also using a scheme to build such class numbers.

It has number 0-9 representing the nature of knowledge (0 being information itself, 5 concerning people, 9 being ethnographic, etc.) Where every class composed of that number would be a slicing or subdivision of said body's nature. (i.e. 090 would be the body of knowledge that deals with information, with 9 having an ethnographic approach, making 090 - "Journaling, Self-Documentation";
INSERT ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE)


04.2020 - onwards knaveHaven has come to terms that it is indeed a faceted scheme due to the rules relying on prebuilt contructs as well as the ethos of "ever-evolving" shifting, generating class numbers.


## HISTORY / DEV TIMELINE

### 20.03.20

added folders to drive
the classification system has taken on the form of a folder filesystem on the tentaviely named
001_knavehaven_classification directory on the knaveHaven github.


### 19 - 20.04.20

more documentaion through markdown file in atom rather than scattered through various channels in are.na .

problems with hiearchy and file structure, the system shall now be oriented towards keywords rather than attempting to establish subdivisions/sors of subjects, as well as hiearchial relations to them.

inspiration came from backspacing the colored two people holding hands emoji in markdown


### 21.04.20

started swapping the 100s schedule around, to fit with a natural progression of subjects, by the same scheme of the main schedules. (i.e, INFRASTRUCTURE moved from 020 to 050 due to [5] being associated with [5]00 - SOCIETY, so [0]__ INFO concerning an aspect of [5] society or people interacting as a whole would make 050 - INFRASTRUCTURE )




## TABLES

## MAIN CLASSES


Main Classes of kHC was originally inspired by Chaim Zin's 10 pillars of knowledge.

Somewhere in 11.2019 - 12.2019 knaveHaven came to the realization that they were not interested so heavily in things such as "Pillar 3: Matter and Energy" or "Pillar 4: Space and Earth" so heavily to a point where investing resources into mapping the nuance of these subjects was not worth it. Also, Pillar 8: "Thought and Art" created a huge dissonance in how we perceived knowledge due to thought being a separate category to perceiving knowledge rather than a somatic mean of experiencing art like in Zin's framework. This is an instance of us realizing kHC was less of a general system and more of a specialized one.  

Because of this, we chopped and mixed the pillars of knowledge and renamed them to the following:

The lens of experiencing knowledge is through a strictly hermeunetic and epistemelogical approach, as things such as fundamental forces belong in METAPHYSICAL rather than TECH.
