# KINGDOM_HEARTS_BRAINDUMP


### [Honest Game Trailers | Kingdom Hearts 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNGqsdJt7Y)
by Fandom Games; the first few minutes say some stuff mechanically about the
convolution of the series.

- 1:13 "classic disney characters having serious conversations about
 metaphysics" [^meta]

- 1:30 each with unique encounters to keep things interesting between
30 minutes cutscenes [^pace]

- 1:50 of Kingdom Hearts 3 that cobbles
together different mechanics from previous games to spice up its ps2 era
corridor levels as you change your Keyblade in two different forms to
unleash a bevy of particle effects and over-the-top finishers and has you
running up walls grinding rails and twirling around on poles like
a cheap stripper making the already floaty gameplay feel more disorienting
than chugging nyquil on a merry-go-round until you summon a literal
merry-go-round as you wipeout swathes of enemies with Disney theme park rides
because I guess they weren't quite breaking the fourth wall enough already
in fights where the particle effects are
flying so thick and fast that the most
relevant combat skill is having any idea
what the is going on yeah I'm 90% sure
this game is just an attempt to kill
epileptic people [^rep]

it's also 13 min long !!!

### [Kingdom Hearts 3 and fulfillment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJv7Hn85Opk)
by PostMesmeric. I guess talking about longing and conclusion, nostalgia factor and
getting caught up in the romanticization of it?? Not only a fan ethnography but also a
 study on expressing resolution?

 - 4:55 "themes of identity, SOCIAL COMPLETION, interpersonal aswell as extrapersonal connections,
 so many series of arcs and connections---installments connected by some bizarre circumstance--
 self containment, new elements upon addition more then convolute
  the narrative than let each installment its essentiality

- 6:48 these elements [straight forward nature of introducing worlds and meeting characters, accomoda
ting sora in fine balance of nuance and familiarity] are
pushed away for introducing franchises and recreating iconic moments in the films

- 13:50
The different spin-offs and side-stories, regardless of their essentiality on a narrative
evel, really lacked focus when it came to actually playing them.
There was always some new bizarre system that was implemented, forcing players to learn
new rules and stipulations, while adjusting to things like cooldowns and skill decks.
For the time when these side stories were in full swing, Kingdom Hearts lacked an internal
gameplay identity, and I believe that was to the series’ detriment.
That’s why A Fragmentary Passage was so enlightening to me; this felt like a balanced
melding of all of the best elements of the non-numbered games.

- 14:50 for me, anyway, the elegance of Kingdom Hearts’ best combat moments came from **FLOW**.
Despite having heavy emphasis on role-playing staples like experience, equipment, and leveling
up stats, none of it was a reliance.
Kingdom Hearts can be enjoyed by many different kinds of gamers, whether you’re a number

- 15:36 concentric combat system; the mechanics and skills all orbit a common theme of **flow**.
You can quickly jump from a melee combo into a form change, then use a magic attack, activate
a partner’s ability, and achieve the killing blow with your new Keyblade’s special finisher.

- 19:18 "The skyscraping city of San Fransokyo and the open waters of the Caribbean deliver their
appeal uniquely, though digestibly. -- The former acts as a more open-ended battleground, with plenty of vertical dimension and Flowmotion
opportunities. The latter is a mini version of something like Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, with
small islands to explore and other ships to battle.
I was admittedly put-off at first by how different these worlds were from what I expected a Kingdom
Hearts world to be, but in professing recognizable moments and delivering combat in digestible
portions to intake, I grew to appreciate them.
KH3’s more experimental worlds spin the wheel of what to expect in a more creatively
architected stage. --
But these cases in KH3 present the world in a clever way without drastically neutering
the player’s combat and navigation options.""

- 20:22 The experimentalism in these worlds complements a more relaxed difficulty, because it gives
designers opportunities to develop challenge in more unconventional ways.
Building up your ship’s strength while exploring the Caribbean was something I grew to love,
even though it was essentially an altered form of grinding.
Pursuing enemies on skyscrapers in San Fransokyo was exciting, giving me room to practice with
Flowmotion.
When Kingdom Hearts III takes advantage of these opportunities, a lighter difficulty
makes a bit more sense.
These moments preserve the fun of the combat without neutering the player and their skills [^options]


- 23:00 - Beyond the Gummiphone selfies, the Instagram-esque loading screens, the corporate preservation
of subject matter slithering into both the gameplay and world design, Kingdom Hearts
III feels like just as much a passion project as Kingdom Hearts 1 did...
For all of the corporate influences they may have at the end of the day, they feel untouched,
unshackled from the kind of focus group testing that morphs them into something homogenized
and uninteresting...Because I can point out flaws till the sun goes down, but that doesn’t mean a damn
thing when the flaws are making a game feel so full of passion, so human in its misled
...Fulfillment can do that for you. [^human]


### [Kingdom Hearts IV (4) Sora's Reward Theory by NoirLilbomber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWgsUjcafM)

- 8:16 "clearly a parallel between Donald and goofy...both sora and yozora chase
a girl on a journey and slip away once in their grasp" [^fleet]


### [Abrahamic Symbolism in Kingdom Hearts (1/3) - Lost in Context Episode 5 by Nenilein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn0xLjOKHns)

this is the best kh video tbh

- 3:02 They say the kingdom key and kingdom key d is
a vidual reference to keys of the kingdom in catholicism

- 3:46 "despite the oconography, they don't use a christian or jewish framework
... namely daoism where everything in the world exists in two extremes which complete eachother
reaching their ultimate form when they come together"

- 4:51 "Kingdom Hearts, however, uses Christian symbols... within a Daoist framework, deliberately drawing
attention to the struggle between the two philosophies in the process, and, to some
extent, even trying to reconcile them. "

- 5:19 Japan has a long history of **syncretism**, the practice of freely
combining foreign belief-systems with one's own, treating the new material as an augmentation
to the old believes, rather than a contradiction or a threat to them.

- 8:55
AESTHETICS, doves flocking in the heart stations, doves are a symbol of peace
then after a disembodied voice starts to guide them-- "don't be afraid" a
phrase used in the bible when people are overwhelmed by a situation--communicating
to be at ease and take the tutorial at your own pace

- ~10:13 dive to the heart are stain glass windows, used in churches in the gothic
style of architecture , due to the romanesque style placing a load on the outer
walls that wouldve crushed the large windows from the weight of the roof, making
churches dark and gloomy places, despite religion being an
attempt to be surrounded by God's light


- ~10:40 the gothic style was to take the load off more, for the sake of making
the weight "lighter" while also letting in visible "light" to enter these spaces
 **"the less the walls had to bear, the more light could enter the church"**
 letting light from outside, the more light that came in the more praying felt
 closer to God.

- 11:00 they talk about how since the stain glass windows were pictures,
 and can be seen from outside, it was the poor mans bible because you did not
 have to be literate to to experience christian canon, the narrow glass at the
 side of the heart stations look like the real life ones, while the heart stations
 also telling stories about the visitor/ who owns the heart, depicting destiny,
 and people close to them, gleaming and glowing a reflection of their hearts light much
 like celebrating the heart of God

 - ~12:05 they talk about destati song playing sounding like a "sacred" and
 "forbidden" piece, yoko shimomura says it is the dark nature of KH

 - 13:31 cross like symbols representing the land of departure trio, and their
 armor looking like crusaders

 - devils and angles representing different wings, light and darkness

 - ~14:48 goes more in depth to how light and darkness are like yin and yang,
 where riku uses dark type attacks and abilities while being on the side of good,
 and eraqus using light and suppressing darkness to kill one of his own.
fairy godmother talks about this too

- the world that never was seems more monastic?

- org xiii is twisted christian symbols, tera being a link between org xiii and
the heroic LoD trio, is a commentary of this twisted use of symbols


## [Awakening & Lore | Philosophy in Kingdom Hearts by Crimson Jake ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFOwYsIk7TQ)
i like this one bc it's a deep dive into self actualization and becoming an
adult/best self

## [Christianity in Kingdom Hearts - Video Essay (Part 1) by HatManMatt (ZadokDestati)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbktHfwr2No)

another christianity in KH series, this one is well produced and uses different
instances from the bible


## [Exploring the Broken Chain of Memories | Kingdom Hearts by
Jacqueline Merritt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyjRo_GWuZY)
She does really good studies on the game design in KH


## [Why the Story of Kingdom Hearts 3 Makes No Sense by Critique Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIoqrc7HTgI)

This one talks about how fragmented the series is in terms of production and
accessibility across different lines of consoles.

## [The Consequences of Floaty Combat in Kingdom Hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWh1faBaAA)

9:05 "Action games are THE genre when players are forced to be creative with their options
and characters express themself in creative play...it feels the developers have failed the
player in some way due to being forced to camp and restrained with their options."

Bloodybizkitz in general is great when analyzing combat mechanics. He has good insight
on choice, narrative autonomy and importance, and even platforming on the series in
other videos. This video also has instances of how combos are faulty from game to game.

## [Kingdom Hearts II - Beyond the X Button by mieDAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc8hrXyG1xw)

talks about how there is a hidden depth to KHII but the game doesn't communicate this successfully.
there is no incentive to learn this battle system [incentive]


## [Situation Commands - The Continued Influence of Birth by Sleep by mieDAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdCIAldWPm0)

"

you go right ahead these mechanics may
07:41
not stand out so players who prefer the
07:43
more cinematic Flair and fireworks that
07:45
various commands produce in other games
07:46
but for me I prefer being more in
07:49
control over what I'm doing
07:50
choosing how to best utilize my
07:52
available tools on the spot is important
07:54
to me and the ability to combine said
07:56
tools helps create interesting scenarios

---

[^meta]: juxtaposition of different medias and genres
[^pace]: stimulation and over compensation for empty design in previous games
[^rep]:  sums up dbz-anime rogue like power fantasy experience (idk what to call this for now, catharsis?)
[^options]: talks about designing environments without taking away familiarity, like in the caribbean world you can create
an activity and make it *feel* new while doing the same monotonous thing, with the san fran sokyo it seems to be more of a
playground or sandbox to practice a skill [flowmotion] without consequence or goal where you couldnt practice other wise---> maybe connect
with journey's long term and short term goals with the gaps in between??
[^human]: there's a lot of stuff about how fulfillment is communicated through imperfection, messy, and unstructuredness
to a point where the executions like memorabilia and fun aoe attacks are celebrated to compensate, it helps even more When
the author of this video repeats and rephrases themself a lot hm.
[^fleet]: author makes parallel to chars in diff worldlines, connected by the
theme of chasing fleeting things

[^incentive]: this is similar to low skill floors and high skill ceilings
