### [Honest Game Trailers | Kingdom Hearts 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNGqsdJt7Y)
by Fandom Games; the first few minutes say some stuff mechanically about the convolution of the series.

- 1:13 "classic disney characters having serious conversations about metaphysics" [^meta]
- 1:30 each with unique encounters to keep things interesting between 30 minutes cutscenes [^pace]
- 1:50 of Kingdom Hearts 3 that cobbles
together different mechanics from previous games to spice up its ps2 era
corridor levels as you change your Keyblade in two different forms to
unleash a bevy of particle effects and over-the-top finishers and has you
running up walls grinding rails and twirling around on poles like
a cheap stripper making the already floaty gameplay feel more disorienting
than chugging nyquil on a merry-go-round until you summon a literal
merry-go-round as you wipeout swathes of enemies with Disney theme park rides
because I guess they weren't quite breaking the fourth wall enough already
in fights where the particle effects are
flying so thick and fast that the most
relevant combat skill is having any idea
what the is going on yeah I'm 90% sure
this game is just an attempt to kill
epileptic people [^rep]

### [Kingdom Hearts 3 and fulfillment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJv7Hn85Opk)
by PostMesmeric. I guess talking about longing and conclusion, nostalgia factor and
getting caught up in the romanticization of it?? Not only a fan ethnography but also a
 study on expressing resolution?

 - 4:55 "themes of identity, SOCIAL COMPLETION, interpersonal aswell as extrapersonal connections,
 so many series of arcs and connections---installments connected by some bizarre circumstance--
 self containment, new elements upon addition more then convolute
  the narrative than let each installment its essentiality

- 6:48 these elements [straight forward nature of introducing worlds and meeting characters, accomoda
ting sora in fine balance of nuance and familiarity] are
pushed away for introducing franchises and recreating iconic moments in the films

- 13:50
The different spin-offs and side-stories, regardless of their essentiality on a narrative
evel, really lacked focus when it came to actually playing them.
There was always some new bizarre system that was implemented, forcing players to learn
new rules and stipulations, while adjusting to things like cooldowns and skill decks.
For the time when these side stories were in full swing, Kingdom Hearts lacked an internal
gameplay identity, and I believe that was to the series’ detriment.
That’s why A Fragmentary Passage was so enlightening to me; this felt like a balanced
melding of all of the best elements of the non-numbered games.

- 14:50 for me, anyway, the elegance of Kingdom Hearts’ best combat moments came from **FLOW**.
Despite having heavy emphasis on role-playing staples like experience, equipment, and leveling
up stats, none of it was a reliance.
Kingdom Hearts can be enjoyed by many different kinds of gamers, whether you’re a number

- 15:36 concentric combat system; the mechanics and skills all orbit a common theme of **flow**.
You can quickly jump from a melee combo into a form change, then use a magic attack, activate
a partner’s ability, and achieve the killing blow with your new Keyblade’s special finisher.

- 19:18 "The skyscraping city of San Fransokyo and the open waters of the Caribbean deliver their
appeal uniquely, though digestibly. -- The former acts as a more open-ended battleground, with plenty of vertical dimension and Flowmotion
opportunities. The latter is a mini version of something like Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, with
small islands to explore and other ships to battle.
I was admittedly put-off at first by how different these worlds were from what I expected a Kingdom
Hearts world to be, but in professing recognizable moments and delivering combat in digestible
portions to intake, I grew to appreciate them.
KH3’s more experimental worlds spin the wheel of what to expect in a more creatively
architected stage. --
But these cases in KH3 present the world in a clever way without drastically neutering
the player’s combat and navigation options.""

- 20:22 The experimentalism in these worlds complements a more relaxed difficulty, because it gives
designers opportunities to develop challenge in more unconventional ways.
Building up your ship’s strength while exploring the Caribbean was something I grew to love,
even though it was essentially an altered form of grinding.
Pursuing enemies on skyscrapers in San Fransokyo was exciting, giving me room to practice with
Flowmotion.
When Kingdom Hearts III takes advantage of these opportunities, a lighter difficulty
makes a bit more sense.
These moments preserve the fun of the combat without neutering the player and their skills [^options]


- 23:00 - Beyond the Gummiphone selfies, the Instagram-esque loading screens, the corporate preservation
of subject matter slithering into both the gameplay and world design, Kingdom Hearts
III feels like just as much a passion project as Kingdom Hearts 1 did...
For all of the corporate influences they may have at the end of the day, they feel untouched,
unshackled from the kind of focus group testing that morphs them into something homogenized
and uninteresting...Because I can point out flaws till the sun goes down, but that doesn’t mean a damn
thing when the flaws are making a game feel so full of passion, so human in its misled
...Fulfillment can do that for you. [^human]


---

[^meta]: juxtaposition of different medias and genres
[^pace]: stimulation and over compensation for empty design in previous games
[^rep]:  sums up dbz-anime rogue like power fantasy experience (idk what to call this for now, catharsis?)
[^options]: talks about designing environments without taking away familiarity, like in the caribbean world you can create
an activity and make it *feel* new while doing the same monotonous thing, with the san fran sokyo it seems to be more of a
playground or sandbox to practice a skill [flowmotion] without consequence or goal where you couldnt practice other wise---> maybe connect
with journey's long term and short term goals with the gaps in between??
[^human]: there's a lot of stuff about how fulfillment is communicated through imperfection, messy, and unstructuredness
to a point where the executions like memorabilia and fun aoe attacks are celebrated to compensate, it helps even more When
the author of this video repeats and rephrases themself a lot hm.
